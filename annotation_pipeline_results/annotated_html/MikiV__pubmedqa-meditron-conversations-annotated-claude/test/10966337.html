<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children&#x27;s hospital, The New Children&#x27;s Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children&#x27;s Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children&#x27;s Hospital) of admissions, w</div>

  </div>
  <div class="message">yes
Outcome: This study demonstrates the usefulness of a short stay ward in a general and academic children&#x27;s hospital. The short stay ward is a useful addition to the emergency service, and the efficiency of bed usage is increased. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of <span class="ann" title="Supported: This specific figure appears in the published research study found in search results" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$1/2 million</span> (Westmead Hospital) to <span class="ann" title="Supported: This specific figure appears in the published research study found in search results" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$2.3 million</span> (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as the former name of The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead.

The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (<span class="ann" title="Supported: This statistic for Westmead Hospital admission rate appears in the published research study" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">4%</span> [Westmead Hospital] compared to <span class="ann" title="Supported: This statistic for New Children&#x27;s Hospital admission rate appears in the published research study" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">6%</span> [New Children&#x27;s Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high.
Limitations: This study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital and a general hospital. Both these hospitals serve an identical demographic area and the study may not be applicable to other settings.
Relevance: The short stay ward is a useful addition to the emergency service, and the efficiency of bed usage is increased. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children&#x27;s Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children&#x27;s Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high.
