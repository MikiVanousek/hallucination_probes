This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.

The diagnosis of sleep disorders is usually based on the results of a medical examination, such as a polysomnography, or a clinical interview. The severity of sleep disorders can be classified into four types: mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, based on the duration and frequency of sleep disorders. In Japan, the</div>
