<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The i</div>

Explanation: In conclusion, we could not show any significant difference in postoperative liver function, surgical complication rates, and survival between <span class="ann" title="Supported: SLT (Split Liver Transplantation) is a well-established medical abbreviation confirmed in multiple medical sources and studies comparing SLT with LRT in pediatric liver transplantation." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">SLT</span> and <span class="ann" title="Supported: LRT (Living-Related liver transplantation) is a well-established medical abbreviation confirmed in multiple medical sources, including the exact study title &#x27;Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?&#x27; found in search results." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">LRT</span>. However, there is a trend toward a better outcome for LRT. The need for LRT will remain in children who have a high risk for graft loss after SLT, for example, in case of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Steatosis (fatty infiltration of the liver) is confirmed as a risk factor for graft loss in liver transplantation, with multiple studies showing macrosteatosis &gt;30% is associated with increased risk of graft failure." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">steatosis</span>, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Small-for-size syndrome is a well-documented clinical condition in liver transplantation literature, defined as graft dysfunction due to inadequate liver volume, confirmed in multiple medical sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">small-for-size syndrome</span>, and in patients with a high <span class="ann" title="Supported: MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score is a well-established scoring system for liver transplant prioritization, confirmed in multiple medical sources.
