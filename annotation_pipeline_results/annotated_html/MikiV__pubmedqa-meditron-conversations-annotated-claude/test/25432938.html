<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile&#x27;s traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years&#x27; effects and regions&#x27; effects represented control variables.

Explanation: The <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple academic sources confirm Chile enacted a comprehensive traffic law reform in 2005, introducing measures like child restraint systems, seat belt mandates, cellphone prohibitions while driving, and increased drunk driving penalties." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Chilean traffic law reform of 2005</span> has been <span class="ann" title="Supported: Research shows the 2005 reform was associated with significant reductions in traffic fatalities and injuries. Studies found reductions ranging from 7-59% in fatalities and 7-37% in severe injuries, depending on the specific analysis and time period." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">effective in reducing traffic fatalities and severe injuries</span>. However, the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Academic studies show varying effectiveness between fatalities and injuries. For example, one study found 8% reduction in fatalities vs 7% in severe injuries, and another found 59% reduction in fatalities vs 37% in severe injuries, supporting that injury reductions were generally less pronounced." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">reduction in traffic injuries is not as pronounced as the reduction in traffic fatalities</span>. This is due to the fact that the <span class="ann" title="Supported: The year 2005 is consistently cited across multiple academic sources as when Chile&#x27;s traffic law reform was enacted." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2005</span> <span class="ann" title="Supported: Research explicitly distinguishes between the traffic law reform and road infrastructure investment as separate variables. Studies found that while the law reform was effective, road infrastructure investment had separate and sometimes limited effects on safety outcomes." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">traffic law reform, while improving road safety, did not improve road infrastructure</span>. The findings of this study have implications for other countries, particularly those that have a similar traffic culture and road infrastructure.</div>
