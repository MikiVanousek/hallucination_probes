<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (&gt;90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of</div>

# Introduction
Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in populations of European descent [bib_ref] <span class="ann" title="Supported: There is a real article " style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Resting heart rate in cardiovascular disease, Fox</span> [/bib_ref]. In a prospective cohort study of 370,000 men and women, each 10 bpm increase in RHR was associated with a 15% increase in the risk of fatal CVD and a 10% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality [bib_ref] Resting heart rate in cardiovascular disease, Fox [/bib_ref]. In an earlier study, RHR was found to be an independent risk factor for CVD mortality in 10,000 men and women aged 40-59 years [bib_ref] Relation of resting heart rate to total mortality after adjusting for underlying..., Zhang [/bib_ref]. The association between RHR and CVD risk appears to be independent of other known risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and obesity [bib_ref] Resting heart rate in cardiovascular disease, Fox [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Resting heart rate as predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with and..., Zeller [/bib_ref]. In a study of 1,250 men and women, elevated RHR (&gt;80 bpm) was found to be a significant risk factor for CVD events and all-cause mortality in the general population [bib_ref] Resting heart rate and the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, Nanchen [/bib_ref].
In sub-Saharan Africa, CVD is a leading cause of death, with hypertension the most common risk factor [bib_ref] Global burden of cardiovascular diseases: part I: general considerations, the epidemiologic transition,..., Yusuf [/bib_ref]. However, there is little data on the role of RHR as a risk factor in this population.
