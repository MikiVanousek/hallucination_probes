<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent of each hospital&#x27;s bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. A retrospective study of HMCIs was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health as&gt;or=10 casualties or&gt;or=4 suffering from injuries wi</div>

  <div class="message">Yes.

Explanation: The current guidelines to prepare for HMCIs are based on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: There is no evidence in the study that readiness is defined as &#x27;each hospital is expected to receive half of its 20% key capacity&#x27; in one event. The guideline says hospitals should have 20% of their bed capacity available for HMCI, but not that half of that 20% will necessarily be used in one event.
