<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile&#x27;s traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years&#x27; effects and regions&#x27; effects represented control variables.

Explanation: The <span class="ann" title="Supported: Chile adopted a comprehensive traffic law reform in 2005, including seat belt requirements, child restraint systems, helmet use, stricter rules on alcohol, speed limits, etc. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6946134/?utm_source=openai))" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Chilean traffic law reform of 2005</span> has been effective in <span class="ann" title="Supported: The reforms are significantly associated with reductions in traffic fatality rates. For example an 8% reduction in fatalities when interacting with enforcement.

However, the reduction in traffic injuries is not as pronounced as the reduction in traffic fatalities. This is due to the fact that the 2005 traffic law reform, while improving road safety, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: On the contrary, studies show that road infrastructure investment was one of the key independent variables and was significantly associated with reductions in pedestrian fatalities.

The findings of this study have implications for other countries, particularly those that have a similar traffic culture and road infrastructure.</div>
