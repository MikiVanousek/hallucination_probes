We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.

In Japan, sleep disorders are managed as a health problem under the category of&#x27;sleep disturbance&#x27; by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The&#x27;sleep disturbance&#x27; category includes sleep disorders, such as insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The diagnosis of sleep disorders is usually based on the results of a medical examination, such as a polysomnography, or a clinical interview. The severity of sleep disorders can be classified into four types: mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, based on the duration and frequency of sleep disorders. In Japan, the</div>
