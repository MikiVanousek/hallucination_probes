<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> Female citizens of Sami (the indigenous people of Norway) municipalities in northern Norway have a low risk of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group. A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value&lt;0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p&lt;0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-S</div>

Explanation: The attendance rate in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: NBCSP stands for Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program, confirmed in multiple search results from the study by Norum et al. 2012." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">NBCSP</span> is high in both the Sami and the non-Sami population. The Sami population had a lower percentage of screen detected breast cancer compared with the non-Sami population. The attendance rate is high in both populations. Further research is needed to investigate if the low percentage of screen detected breast cancer in the Sami population is due to a lower incidence of breast cancer, lower sensitivity of the screening program, or a lower compliance to the recommended treatment of screen detected cancer.</div>
