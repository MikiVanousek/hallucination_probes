<div class="subtle"><strong>context:</strong> The precise correction of refractive error is especially important in young adults. It is unclear whether cycloplegic refraction is necessary in this age group. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults. This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n = 700) of enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21 years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1 % was installed twice 10 min apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40 min later using an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractive measurements was analyzed. The mean difference in SE between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68 ± 0.83 D (95 % CI, 0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than myopes (1.30 ± 0.90 D versus 0.46 ± 0.68 D, p &lt; 0.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 to</div>

Keywords: Cycloplegic autorefraction, Hypermetropia, Myopia, Refractive error, Young adults Background The precise correction of refractive error is especially important in young adults [bib_ref] <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The reference to &#x27;The refractive status of young adults, Tarrant&#x27; could not be verified in the provided sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">The refractive status of young adults, Tarrant</span> [/bib_ref]. For example, young adults who have been wearing incorrect refractive correction for years may experience symptoms of blurred vision, asthenopia, and headaches. The effect of incorrect correction on the visual system is still unknown; however, some studies have suggested that it may have a negative effect on visual acuity [bib_ref] <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The reference to &#x27;Visual acuity and the eye examination, Binkhorst&#x27; could not be verified in the provided sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Visual acuity and the eye examination, Binkhorst</span> [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The reference to &#x27;The effect of ametropia on visual acuity, Binkhorst&#x27; could not be verified in the provided sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">The effect of ametropia on visual acuity, Binkhorst</span> [/bib_ref]. The degree of refractive error may be under-or over-estimated in young adults when a non-cycloplegic refraction is performed. The use of a cycloplegic agent may improve the accuracy of refractive error measurement in young adults. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults.
