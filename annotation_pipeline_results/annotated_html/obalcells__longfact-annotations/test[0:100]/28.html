  <div class="message">Alfred Adler (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Alfred Adler was born February 7, 1870 and died May 28, 1937." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1870-1937</span>) was an Austrian medical doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of the school of individual psychology. He is considered one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, alongside Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

**Early Life and Education**

Alfred Adler was born on <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed across multiple sources as Adler&#x27;s birth date." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">February 7, 1870</span>, in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he was born in Rudolfsheim, a suburb of Vienna." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Rudolfsheim</span>, a suburb of Vienna, Austria. His father, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as his father&#x27;s name in multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Leopold Adler</span>, was a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Leopold Adler was a Hungarian-born grain merchant." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">grain merchant</span>, and his mother, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources consistently show his mother&#x27;s name as Pauline (Beer) Adler or just Pauline Adler, not Pauline Kanner Adler." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Pauline Kanner Adler</span>, was a homemaker. Adler was the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he was the second of seven children." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">second of seven children</span>. He grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in a middle-class environment.

Adler studied medicine at the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed he studied medicine at the University of Vienna." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">University of Vienna</span>, where he earned his medical degree in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he earned his medical degree in 1895." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1895</span>. He worked as a physician in Vienna&#x27;s inner city and later became interested in psychiatry and psychology.

**Theories and Contributions**

Adler&#x27;s individual psychology focuses on the concept of &quot;striving for superiority&quot; or &quot;will to power.&quot; He believed that individuals strive to overcome their weaknesses and achieve a sense of superiority over others. This striving is a fundamental drive that motivates human behavior.

Adler&#x27;s key concepts include:

1. **The inferiority complex**: Adler believed that individuals experience feelings of inferiority due to their physical, social, or intellectual limitations. This feeling can lead to compensatory behaviors, such as overachievement or aggression.
2. **The superiority complex**: On the other hand, individuals may develop a superiority complex, where they overestimate their abilities and feel superior to others.
3. **Social interest**: Adler emphasized the importance of social interest, which refers to an individual&#x27;s concern for the well-being of others and their willingness to cooperate with others.
4. **Style of life**: Adler introduced the concept of style of life, which refers to an individual&#x27;s unique way of living, including their values, goals, and behaviors.

**Notable Works and Events**

Some of Adler&#x27;s notable works include:

1. **&quot;<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The book exists but was first published in English in 1924, not 1927. The 1927 date refers to a German edition." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">The Practice and Theory of Individual Psychology&quot;** (1927</span>): This book is considered one of Adler&#x27;s most important works, where he outlines his individual psychology theory.
2. **&quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as published in 1931 across multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">What Life Should Mean to You&quot;** (1931</span>): In this book, Adler discusses the concept of style of life and its importance in achieving personal growth and fulfillment.

Adler was also a prolific writer and published numerous articles and books on psychology and education. He was a popular speaker and lecturer, and his ideas influenced many fields, including education, social work, and business.
