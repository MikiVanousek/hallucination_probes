  <div class="message">The Famous Marshmallow Experiment, also known as the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment, was conducted by psychologist <span class="ann" title="Supported: Walter Mischel was indeed the psychologist who conducted the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Walter Mischel</span> in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: The experiment was conducted in the 1960s, with sources confirming it began in the late 1960s and continued into the early 1970s." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1960s</span>. The primary focus of the experiment was to study the concept of delayed gratification and self-control in children.

**Background and Location:**
The experiment took place at <span class="ann" title="Supported: The experiment was conducted at Stanford University&#x27;s Bing Nursery School, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Stanford University</span> in California, USA. Walter Mischel, a renowned psychologist, led the research team. The study was conducted in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources consistently indicate the experiment began in the late 1960s (around 1967-1968), not 1963. The first major study was published in 1970." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1963</span>, and it involved a total of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm that over 600 children participated in the studies, with one source specifically mentioning 653 preschoolers participated between 1968 and 1974." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">600 children</span> from <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources indicate the participants were primarily children of Stanford faculty and staff, representing a largely middle to upper-middle-class demographic, not low-income families." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">low-income families</span> in Stanford.

**The Experiment:**
The experiment consisted of three phases:

1. **Introduction and Setup:** The children were brought into a room, where they were offered a marshmallow as a reward for participating in the study. The marshmallow was placed in front of them, and they were told that they could eat it immediately or wait for a short period to receive a second marshmallow as a reward.
2. **Delay of Gratification:** The children were left alone in the room with the marshmallow, and they were instructed to wait for a short period (usually <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the standard waiting period was about 15 minutes, though some variations used up to 20 minutes." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">15 minutes</span>) before they could eat the marshmallow. The researchers observed the children&#x27;s behavior through a one-way mirror, noting how they coped with the delay.
3. **Follow-up:** After the delay period, the children were offered a second marshmallow as a reward for waiting. The researchers also conducted follow-up interviews with the children to assess their self-control and ability to delay gratification.

**Key Findings:**
The experiment revealed some fascinating insights into the concept of delayed gratification:

* **Children who waited longer received a second marshmallow:** Approximately <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific percentage statistics about how many children waited the full time were found in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">30%</span> of the children waited for the full 15 minutes, while about <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific percentage statistics about how many children ate the marshmallow immediately were found in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">70%</span> ate the marshmallow immediately.
* **Children who waited longer performed better in life:** The researchers conducted follow-up studies with the children, and they found that those who had waited longer for the marshmallow tended to perform better in school, had better social skills, and were more likely to achieve their goals in life.
* **Children who ate the marshmallow immediately struggled with self-control:** The children who ate the marshmallow immediately tended to struggle with self-control and impulsivity, which affected their behavior and decision-making in various aspects of life.

**Notable Participants:**
Some notable participants in the experiment include:

* **<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No evidence found of a specific participant named &#x27;Jack&#x27; in any of the sources about the marshmallow experiment." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Jack</span>:** A <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: This appears to be a fabricated specific example, as no such individual participant details are documented in the sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">4-year-old boy</span> who waited for the full 15 minutes and received a second marshmallow. Jack&#x27;s ability to delay gratification was remarkable, and he went on to achieve great success in life.
* **<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No evidence found of a specific participant named &#x27;Sally&#x27; in any of the sources about the marshmallow experiment." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Sally</span>:** A <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: This appears to be a fabricated specific example, as no such individual participant details are documented in the sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">3-year-old girl</span> who ate the marshmallow immediately. Sally&#x27;s impulsivity and lack of self-control led to difficulties in her life, including struggles with addiction and relationships.

**Legacy of the Experiment:**
The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment has had a significant impact on our understanding of human behavior and decision-making. The study has been widely cited and has influenced various fields, including psychology, education, and economics. The concept of delayed gratification has become a crucial aspect of personal development and success.

**Walter Mischel&#x27;s Later Work:**
Walter Mischel continued to study the concept of self-control and delayed gratification throughout his career. He published several books, including &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is indeed the title of Walter Mischel&#x27;s book, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control</span>&quot; (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the book was published in 2014, specifically September 2014." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2014</span>), which provides an in-depth analysis of the experiment and its findings.

In summary, the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment was a groundbreaking study that explored the concept of delayed gratification and self-control in children. The experiment&#x27;s findings have had a lasting impact on our understanding of human behavior and decision-making, and its legacy continues to influence various fields today.</div>
