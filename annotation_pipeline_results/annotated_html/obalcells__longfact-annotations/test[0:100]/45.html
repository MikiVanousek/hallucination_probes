  <div class="message">Max Theiler was a South African-born British medical researcher who made significant contributions to the field of virology. He was born on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple reliable sources consistently state Max Theiler was born on January 30, 1899, not June 30, 1899. This is confirmed by Nobel Prize official biography, Wikipedia, Britannica, and other authoritative sources." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">June 30, 1899</span>, in Pretoria, South Africa, to a <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources consistently state that both of Max Theiler&#x27;s parents emigrated from Switzerland, not Germany.

Theiler earned his medical degree from the <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Max Theiler attended University of Cape Town Medical School, graduating in 1918, not University of Pretoria in 1921. He then went to London for further medical training." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">University of Pretoria in 1921</span>. He then moved to the United Kingdom, where he worked at the <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No sources found confirm that Theiler worked at the Lister Institute. Sources consistently state he studied at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London</span>. In 1922, he began working under the supervision of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While Sir Almroth Wright was a real British bacteriologist, no sources found confirm that Max Theiler worked under his supervision at any institution." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Sir Almroth Wright</span>, a renowned British bacteriologist.

In 1926, Theiler moved to the United States to work at the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that Theiler moved to the Rockefeller Foundation (also called Rockefeller Institute) in New York in 1930, where he became director of the Virus Laboratory." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</span> (now Rockefeller University) in New York City. During his time at the Rockefeller Institute, he conducted extensive research on yellow fever, a viral disease that was prevalent in tropical regions.

Theiler&#x27;s work on yellow fever led to the development of a vaccine against the disease. He <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate that by 1927 Theiler and colleagues proved yellow fever was caused by a virus (not a bacterium), but the virus isolation and identification had been done earlier by other researchers like Adrian Stokes." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">isolated the yellow fever virus in 1927</span> and began experimenting with different methods of inactivating the virus. In 1936, he developed a method of inactivating the virus using <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No sources mention formaldehyde in connection with Theiler&#x27;s vaccine development. The 17D vaccine was developed through serial passage in chicken embryos, not through formaldehyde inactivation." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">formaldehyde</span>, which resulted in the creation of a safe and effective vaccine.

Theiler&#x27;s yellow fever vaccine was first tested in humans in 1936. The initial trials were conducted in the United States, but later, the vaccine was tested in Africa, where yellow fever was a major public health concern. The vaccine was found to be highly effective in preventing the disease, and it was soon adopted for use in yellow fever-endemic regions.

Theiler&#x27;s work on yellow fever earned him numerous awards and recognition. In 1951, he was awarded the <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Max Theiler received the 1951 Nobel Prize alone, not shared with a team. All sources confirm he was the sole recipient of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with a team of researchers from the United States</span>, for his development of the yellow fever vaccine. Theiler was the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that Theiler was the first African-born Nobel laureate when he received the prize in 1951." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">first South African-born scientist to receive the Nobel Prize</span>.

Theiler continued to work at the Rockefeller Institute until his retirement in 1964. He passed away on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources consistently state that Max Theiler died on August 11, 1972, not August 9, 1972." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">August 9, 1972</span>, at the age of 73, in New York City.
