  <div class="message"><span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as Sir Nicholas Harold Lloyd Ridley, British ophthalmologist who invented the intraocular lens" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Harold Ridley</span> was a British ophthalmologist who is best known for developing the first intraocular lens (IOL) for cataract surgery. 

Early Life and Education:
Harold Ridley was born on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm he was born on July 10, 1906, not July 21" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">July 21, 1906</span>, in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: He was born in Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, not London" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">London, England</span>. He studied medicine at <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed he completed his medical training at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital Medical School</span> in London, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm he completed his medical training in 1930, not 1931" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">graduating in 1931</span>. Ridley then went on to pursue a career in ophthalmology, specializing in eye surgery.

Career:
Ridley&#x27;s interest in eye surgery began during World War II, when he served as a surgeon in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps and treated RAF casualties" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Royal Air Force (RAF)</span>. He was involved in treating pilots who had suffered eye injuries, which led him to develop a new approach to cataract surgery.

In <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The first IOL surgery was performed in 1949, not 1948" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1948</span>, Ridley performed the first intraocular lens implantation surgery on a patient named <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The first patient was Emily Attfield, a 46-year-old nurse, not Mr. G. Lloyd" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Mr. G. Lloyd</span>, a <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The first patient was a 46-year-old woman (Emily Attfield), not a 65-year-old man" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">65-year-old man</span> who had suffered a cataract in his left eye. The surgery was a groundbreaking success, and it paved the way for modern cataract surgery.

Ridley&#x27;s IOL design was based on the shape of a pilot&#x27;s cockpit canopy, which he had observed during his time in the RAF. He realized that the smooth, curved surface of the canopy could be adapted to create a lens that would sit comfortably inside the eye.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Ridley continued to refine his IOL design, working with manufacturers to develop a more durable and versatile lens. He also trained other surgeons in the technique of IOL implantation, which helped to popularize the procedure.

Achievements and Legacy:
Ridley&#x27;s development of the intraocular lens revolutionized cataract surgery, making it possible to restore vision to millions of people worldwide. He was awarded numerous honors for his contributions to ophthalmology, including the <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify this specific award and date; sources mention he was knighted in 2000" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1968</span>.

Ridley continued to work as an ophthalmologist until his retirement in the 1980s. He passed away on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: He died on May 25, 2001, not February 3" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">February 3, 2001</span>, at the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed he died at age 94" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">age of 94</span>.

Interesting Facts:

- Ridley&#x27;s IOL design was initially made of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed the IOL was made from Perspex (PMMA)" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Perspex</span>, a type of acrylic plastic.
- The first IOL implantation surgery took place on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The first surgery was on November 29, 1949, not 1948" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">November 29, 1948</span>, at <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as the location of the first IOL implantation" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital</span> in London.
- Ridley&#x27;s work on IOLs was initially met with skepticism by some of his colleagues, who doubted the feasibility of implanting a lens inside the eye.
- Ridley&#x27;s design has undergone numerous modifications over the years, with modern IOLs made from a variety of materials, including silicone, acrylic, and foldable polymers.</div>
