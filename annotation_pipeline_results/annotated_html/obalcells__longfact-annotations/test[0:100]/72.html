**Plot**

The film follows the story of Mark Zuckerberg (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Jesse Eisenberg played Mark Zuckerberg, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Jesse Eisenberg</span>), a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Mark Zuckerberg was indeed a sophomore at Harvard in 2003 when he created Facemash." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">sophomore at Harvard University in 2003</span>. Mark is a brilliant computer science student who is initially accepted into the exclusive final club, the <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Phoenix Club (Phoenix-S.K. Club) is a real Harvard final club, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Phoenix</span>, but is later rejected. This rejection fuels Mark&#x27;s desire for acceptance and revenge.

Mark creates a website called &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Facemash was a real website created by Zuckerberg in October 2003, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Facemash</span>,&quot; which allows users to compare the photos of two students and vote on which one is more attractive. The site becomes a huge success, but also sparks controversy and is eventually shut down by the university.

Mark is approached by his friends and roommates, Eduardo Saverin (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Andrew Garfield played Eduardo Saverin, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Andrew Garfield</span>), <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Winklevoss twins are real people who were involved in the Facebook lawsuit." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss</span> (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Armie Hammer played both Winklevoss twins, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Armie Hammer</span>), to create a social networking site exclusively for Harvard students. Mark agrees and begins working on the site, which he eventually names &quot;Thefacebook.&quot;

As the site gains popularity, Mark and Eduardo&#x27;s friendship begins to deteriorate. Mark becomes increasingly obsessed with the site and begins to make decisions without consulting Eduardo. The Winklevoss twins also become increasingly involved in the site and begin to suspect that Mark is not giving them the credit they deserve.
