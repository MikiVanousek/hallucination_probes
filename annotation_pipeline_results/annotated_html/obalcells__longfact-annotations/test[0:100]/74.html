  <div class="message">David Baltimore is an American molecular biologist and virologist who has made significant contributions to the field of immunology and cancer research. He was born on <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple reliable sources consistently state Baltimore was born on March 7, 1938, not March 13, 1938." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">March 13, 1938</span>, in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that Baltimore was born in New York City." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">New York City, USA</span>.

**Education and Early Career**

Baltimore received his Bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm he graduated from Swarthmore College in 1960, not 1958." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Swarthmore College in 1958</span>. He then earned his <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that he received his Ph.D. from Rockefeller University in 1964." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Ph.D. in biology from Rockefeller University in 1964</span>, where he worked under the supervision of Nobel laureate <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Baltimore worked under Richard Franklin at Rockefeller, not Joshua Lederberg. Lederberg was president of Rockefeller University from 1978-1990, after Baltimore&#x27;s PhD." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Joshua Lederberg</span>.

**Research and Discoveries**

Baltimore&#x27;s research focused on the molecular mechanisms of viral replication and the interaction between viruses and host cells. In <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Baltimore&#x27;s major discovery in 1970 was reverse transcriptase, not viral oncogenes in 1964. His work on oncogenes came later, around 1980 with Abelson murine leukemia virus." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1964, he discovered the first viral oncogene</span>, which is a gene that can cause cancer when mutated or expressed inappropriately. This discovery was a major breakthrough in understanding the molecular basis of cancer.

**The Baltimore Classification System**

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Baltimore Classification System was indeed developed around 1970-1971, as confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1970, Baltimore developed a classification system for viruses</span> based on their genetic material, which is now widely used in the field of virology. The system categorizes viruses into <span class="ann" title="Supported: The original Baltimore classification had six classes, with a seventh added later." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">six classes</span>: I (dsDNA), II (ssDNA), III (dsRNA), IV (ssRNA), V (reverse transcribing DNA), and VI (reverse transcribing RNA).

**Awards and Honors**

Baltimore has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to science. Some notable awards include:

* <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that Baltimore won the Nobel Prize in 1975." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1975)</span> <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of reverse transcriptase and interaction between tumor viruses and genetic material, not specifically for discovering the first viral oncogene." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">for his discovery of the first viral oncogene</span>
* <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm Baltimore received the National Medal of Science in 1999, not 1981." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">National Medal of Science (1981)</span>
* Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research (1987)
* <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No evidence found that Baltimore received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This appears to be fabricated." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Presidential Medal of Freedom (2007)</span>

**Leadership and Administration**

Baltimore has held various leadership positions in academia and science policy. He served as the <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Baltimore was president of Rockefeller University from 1990 to 1991, not until 2002. He resigned in 1991 due to the Imanishi-Kari controversy." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">President of Rockefeller University from 1990 to 2002</span> and was a member of the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1999 to 2001. He is currently the President Emeritus of Rockefeller University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

**Personal Life**

Baltimore is married to <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Baltimore is married to Dr. Alice S. Huang, not Susan Bachrach. They married in 1968." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Susan Bachrach</span>, and they have <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm Baltimore and Alice Huang have one daughter, not two children." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">two children</span> together. He is an avid sailor and has sailed around the world.

**Notable Collaborations and Mentors**

Baltimore has collaborated with many notable scientists throughout his career, including:

* Joshua Lederberg (mentor)
* <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While Michael Bishop is a real scientist and Nobel laureate, no specific evidence found of collaboration with Baltimore in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Michael Bishop</span> (collaborator)
* <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While Harold Varmus is a real scientist and Nobel laureate, no specific evidence found of collaboration with Baltimore in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Harold Varmus</span> (collaborator)
* <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While James Allison is a real scientist and Nobel laureate, no specific evidence found of collaboration with Baltimore in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">James Allison</span> (collaborator)
