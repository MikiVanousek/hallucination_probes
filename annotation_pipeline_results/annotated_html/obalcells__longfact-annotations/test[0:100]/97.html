  <div class="message">&#x27;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x27; is a historical drama film directed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as the director of Schindler&#x27;s List (1993)" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Steven Spielberg</span>, released in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Film was released in 1993, confirmed by multiple sources" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1993</span>. The movie is based on the true story of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Real historical figure, German industrialist who saved Jews during Holocaust" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Oskar Schindler</span>, a German businessman who saves the lives of thousands of Polish Jews during the Holocaust.

**Plot**

The film begins in 1939, in Krakow, Poland, where Oskar Schindler (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as playing Oskar Schindler in the film" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Liam Neeson</span>) arrives to take advantage of the economic opportunities created by the Nazi occupation. Schindler is a member of the Nazi Party and initially sees the Jews as a means to make a profit. He establishes a factory in Krakow, employing hundreds of Jewish workers, including <span class="ann" title="Supported: Real person, Schindler&#x27;s Jewish accountant, played by Ben Kingsley" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Itzhak Stern</span> (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as playing Itzhak Stern in the film" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Ben Kingsley</span>), a Jewish accountant who helps Schindler navigate the complexities of the Nazi bureaucracy.

As the war escalates, Schindler becomes increasingly aware of the atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jewish population. He witnesses the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto and the deportation of its inhabitants to the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Real concentration camp where Jews from Krakow Ghetto were sent" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Plaszow concentration camp</span>.
