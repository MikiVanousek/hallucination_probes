  <div class="message">Minimalist Architecture is a design philosophy that emphasizes simplicity, clean lines, and a limited color palette to create aesthetically pleasing and functional spaces. This architectural style emerged in the mid-20th century, particularly in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm minimalist architecture emerged in the 1950s-1960s, with the art movement beginning in New York in the early 1960s and architectural minimalism gaining traction around this time period." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1950s and 1960s</span>, as a reaction to the ornate and complex designs of the past.

**Key Principles of Minimalist Architecture:**

1. **Simple Shapes and Geometric Forms:** Minimalist architecture often employs basic geometric forms such as rectangles, circles, and triangles to create a sense of order and balance.
