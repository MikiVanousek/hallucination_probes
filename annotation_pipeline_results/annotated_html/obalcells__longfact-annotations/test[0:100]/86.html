  <div class="message">The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall or Kotel, is a significant religious site in Jerusalem, Israel. It is the last remnant of the Second Temple, a Jewish temple complex that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.

**Location and History**

The Western Wall is located in the Old City of Jerusalem, in the Jewish Quarter, near the Temple Mount. The wall is a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the prayer section is approximately 57 meters long, though the entire Western Wall is 488 meters long." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">187-foot-long (57 meters)</span> section of the ancient wall that surrounded the Temple Mount. It is believed to be the closest point to the site of the Holy of Holies, the innermost sanctum of the Temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept.

**Construction and Architecture**

The Western Wall was built during the reign of King Herod the Great (37-4 BCE) as part of a larger renovation of the Temple Mount. The wall is constructed from large limestone blocks, some of which weigh up to <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate the largest stone weighs approximately 517 tons, not 600 tons. The completion overstates the weight." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">600 tons</span>. The wall is about <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate the visible Western Wall is about 19-20 meters (60+ feet) high, not 15 feet. The completion appears to confuse different measurements." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">15 feet (4.5 meters) high</span> and <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No reliable sources found providing specific thickness measurements of the Western Wall." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">2.5 feet (0.76 meters) thick</span>.

**Significance and Rituals**

The Western Wall is considered one of the most sacred sites in Judaism, and it is a place of great spiritual significance for Jews around the world. The wall is a remnant of the Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. Since then, Jews have been unable to rebuild the Temple, and the Western Wall has become a substitute for prayer and worship.

**Rituals and Traditions**

The Western Wall is a place of great ritual and tradition. Jews from around the world come to the wall to pray, recite psalms, and leave notes and prayers in the cracks between the stones. The wall is also a place of great emotional significance, where Jews come to mourn and grieve the loss of loved ones.
