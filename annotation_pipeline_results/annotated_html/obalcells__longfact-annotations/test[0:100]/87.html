Despite Wiseau&#x27;s unconventional methods and lack of experience, the two begin production on &quot;The Room,&quot; a melodrama about a man&#x27;s descent into madness.

As production progresses, Sestero becomes increasingly frustrated with Wiseau&#x27;s behavior, which includes rewriting the script, changing the story, and making bizarre demands. Despite the chaos, the film is completed, and &quot;The Room&quot; premieres in Los Angeles in 2003.
