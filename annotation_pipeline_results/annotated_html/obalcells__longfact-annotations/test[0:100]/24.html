  <div class="message"><span class="ann" title="Supported: Birth and death dates are confirmed by multiple reliable sources including Wikipedia, Britannica, and other biographical sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Carl Rogers (1902-1987)</span> was a renowned American psychologist and psychotherapist who made significant contributions to the field of humanistic psychology. He is best known for developing person-centered therapy, a non-directive approach that focuses on the client&#x27;s inherent tendency towards self-actualization.

**Early Life and Education**

Carl Rogers was born on <span class="ann" title="Supported: Birth date confirmed by multiple sources including Wikipedia, Britannica, and Oak Park River Forest Museum." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">January 8, 1902</span>, in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Birth location confirmed by multiple sources including Wikipedia, Britannica, and local Oak Park museum." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Oak Park, Illinois</span>, to <span class="ann" title="Supported: Parents&#x27; names confirmed by multiple sources. Father was Walter A. Rogers, mother was Julia M. Cushing Rogers." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Walter and Julia Rogers</span>. He grew up in a middle-class family with <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm Carl was the fourth of six children, not that he had two siblings. He had five siblings total." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">two siblings</span>. Rogers&#x27; early life was marked by a strong interest in psychology, which was influenced by <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No sources found mentioning Julia Rogers having depression. Sources describe her as a devout Christian homemaker but don&#x27;t mention depression." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">his mother&#x27;s struggles with depression</span>. He earned his Bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Graduation from University of Wisconsin in 1924 with Bachelor&#x27;s degree confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">University of Wisconsin in 1924</span> and later completed his <span class="ann" title="Supported: M.A. degree in 1928 from Columbia University Teachers College confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Master&#x27;s degree in 1928</span>. Rogers then pursued his <span class="ann" title="Supported: Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1931 confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University, which he completed in 1931</span>.

**Career and Contributions**

Rogers began his career as a teacher and researcher at the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Rogers lectured at University of Rochester from 1935-1940 according to multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">University of Rochester</span>, where he worked with the famous psychologist, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No sources found connecting Rogers to working with Edward Thorndike at University of Rochester. The Edward Thorndike mentioned in search results was a physicist, not the psychologist." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Edward Thorndike</span>. In the 1930s, Rogers became interested in psychotherapy and began to develop his person-centered approach. He was influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, but he eventually diverged from traditional psychoanalytic theory.

In 1940, Rogers joined the faculty at <span class="ann" title="Supported: Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University in 1940, confirmed by multiple sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Ohio State University</span>, where he developed his person-centered approach further. He published his seminal book, &quot;The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child,&quot; in 1939, which introduced his non-directive approach to therapy. Rogers&#x27; approach emphasized the importance of empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard in the therapeutic relationship.

**Person-Centered Therapy**

Rogers&#x27; person-centered therapy is based on the following core conditions:

1. **Empathy**: The therapist must be able to understand and share the client&#x27;s feelings.
2. **Genuineness**: The therapist must be authentic and genuine in their interactions with the client.
3. **Unconditional Positive Regard**: The therapist must accept the client unconditionally, without judgment or criticism.

Rogers believed that these conditions would allow the client to experience a sense of safety and security, which would facilitate their self-actualization.
