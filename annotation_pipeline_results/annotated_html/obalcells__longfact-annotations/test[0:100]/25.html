  <div class="message">Naughty Dog is an American video game development company based in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that Naughty Dog is based in Santa Monica, California" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Santa Monica, California</span>. The company was founded in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Multiple sources confirm Naughty Dog was founded in 1984, not 1989. The company was renamed from JAM Software to Naughty Dog in 1989" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1989</span> by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as co-founder of Naughty Dog along with Jason Rubin" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Andy Gavin</span> and <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as co-founder of Naughty Dog along with Andy Gavin" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Jason Rubin</span>, two childhood friends who met in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate they met at a weekend Hebrew school in Virginia, not New Haven, Connecticut" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">New Haven, Connecticut</span>, while attending high school. 

Initially, the company was called <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that Naughty Dog was originally called JAM Software before being renamed" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">JAM Software</span>, but it was later renamed to Naughty Dog in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources confirm the company was renamed to Naughty Dog in 1989, not 1992" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1992</span>. The name &quot;Naughty Dog&quot; was inspired by a phrase that <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No sources found to verify this specific claim about the origin of the &#x27;Naughty Dog&#x27; name" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Jason Rubin&#x27;s mother used to call him when he was a child</span>.

Naughty Dog gained recognition with the release of their first game, &quot;<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Crystal Quest was not made by Naughty Dog - it was developed by Patrick Buckland for Macintosh in 1987. Naughty Dog&#x27;s first game was Math Jam in 1985/1986" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Crystal Quest</span>,&quot; in 1989. However, it was their 1994 game &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 1994 fighting game developed by Naughty Dog for 3DO" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Way of the Warrior</span>&quot; that brought them their first major success. The game was a fighting game that featured a unique fighting system and a storyline that was considered groundbreaking for its time.

In 1996, Naughty Dog released &quot;Crash Bandicoot,&quot; a platformer game that became a huge success and helped establish the company as a major player in the gaming industry. The game was developed by a team of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific team size information found for the original Crash Bandicoot development" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">around 20 people</span> and took about <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Crash Bandicoot took 14 months of development, not 18 months" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">18 months</span> to complete. The game&#x27;s success can be attributed to its unique characters, engaging storyline, and challenging gameplay.

The company continued to release successful games, including &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 1997 sequel developed by Naughty Dog" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</span>&quot; in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed release year for Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1997</span> and &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 1998 sequel developed by Naughty Dog" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Crash Bandicoot: Warped</span>&quot; in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed release year for Crash Bandicoot: Warped" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1998</span>. However, it was their 2001 game &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; that marked a significant shift in the company&#x27;s direction. The game was a 3D platformer that featured a unique art style and a deep storyline.

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed release year for Jak X: Combat Racing" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2005</span>, Naughty Dog released &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 2005 racing game developed by Naughty Dog" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Jak X: Combat Racing</span>,&quot; a racing game that featured a unique combat system and a variety of vehicles. However, the game received mixed reviews and was not as successful as the company&#x27;s previous titles.

In 2007, Naughty Dog released &quot;Uncharted: Drake&#x27;s Fortune,&quot; a third-person shooter that featured a unique storyline and engaging characters. The game was developed by a team of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific team size information found for Uncharted: Drake&#x27;s Fortune development" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">around 100 people</span> and took about <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Uncharted: Drake&#x27;s Fortune was in full production for about 2 years, not 3 years" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">3 years</span> to complete. The game&#x27;s success can be attributed to its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and challenging gameplay.

The company continued to release successful games, including &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 2009 sequel developed by Naughty Dog" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</span>&quot; in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed release year for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2009</span> and &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a 2011 sequel developed by Naughty Dog" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception</span>&quot; in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed release year for Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2011</span>. However, it was their 2013 game &quot;The Last of Us&quot; that marked a significant shift in the company&#x27;s direction. The game was a survival horror game that featured a unique storyline and deep characters.

In 2016, Naughty Dog released &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End,&quot; a third-person shooter that featured a unique storyline and engaging characters. The game was developed by a team of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific team size information found for Uncharted 4 development" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">around 500 people</span> and took about <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific development time information found for Uncharted 4" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">5 years</span> to complete. The game&#x27;s success can be attributed to its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and challenging gameplay.

In 2020, Naughty Dog released &quot;The Last of Us Part II,&quot; a survival horror game that featured a unique storyline and deep characters. The game was developed by a team of around 500 people and took about 5 years to complete. The game&#x27;s success can be attributed to its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and challenging gameplay.

Today, Naughty Dog is considered one of the most successful and respected game development companies in the industry. The company has a team of around 500 people and is known for its commitment to creating high-quality games that push the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay.
