    <div class="subtle"><strong>user_prompt:</strong> What is the controversy behind the Wells Fargo account fraud scandal? Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)
</div>
  </div>
  <div class="message">The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal, also known as the &quot;Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal,&quot; refers to a widespread practice of employees opening unauthorized customer accounts to meet sales targets and earn bonuses. The scandal led to significant financial and reputational losses for the bank, as well as regulatory actions and lawsuits.

**Background:**

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: Cross-selling strategy implementation date is confirmed as starting around 2013 in multiple sources, though some sources indicate it began earlier in 2002." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2013</span>, Wells Fargo began implementing a sales strategy called &quot;cross-selling,&quot; which aimed to increase revenue by selling customers additional financial products, such as credit cards, loans, and investment accounts. To meet sales targets, employees were incentivized with bonuses and promotions for opening new accounts.

**Scandal Unfolds:**

In 2013, a Wells Fargo employee in Los Angeles, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: No evidence found of a Wells Fargo employee named Patricia H. Morris reporting concerns in 2013. This appears to be a fabricated name and story." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Patricia H. Morris</span>, reported to her supervisor that she was being pressured to open unauthorized accounts to meet sales targets. Morris&#x27;s concerns were ignored, and she eventually left the company.

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: 2015 is correctly cited as when Los Angeles filed its lawsuit against Wells Fargo over unauthorized accounts." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2015</span>, a Wells Fargo employee in <span class="ann" title="Supported: California, particularly Los Angeles, was indeed a key location in the scandal investigations." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">California</span>, Annette Bongiorno, was fired after she was accused of opening unauthorized accounts. Bongiorno later became a key witness in the scandal, testifying that she and other employees were instructed to open fake accounts to meet sales targets.

**Regulatory Actions:**

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: 2016 is correctly identified as when the CFPB and OCC launched their investigation and imposed fines." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2016</span>, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) launched an investigation into Wells Fargo&#x27;s sales practices. The investigation found that between <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the fraudulent practices began as early as 2002." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2002</span> and 2016, Wells Fargo employees opened approximately <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm approximately 2 million unauthorized accounts were opened, with later estimates reaching 3.5 million." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2 million unauthorized customer accounts</span>, resulting in $2.6 billion in fees and interest charges.

**Regulatory Fines and Penalties:**

In <span class="ann" title="Supported: September 8, 2016 is correctly identified as when the $185 million fine was announced." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">September 2016</span>, the CFPB and OCC imposed a $185 million fine on Wells Fargo, which was the largest fine ever imposed on a bank at the time. The fine was divided among the CFPB (<span class="ann" title="Supported: CFPB portion of the fine was indeed $100 million." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$100 million</span>), the OCC (<span class="ann" title="Supported: OCC portion of the fine was indeed $35 million." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$35 million</span>), and the Federal Reserve (<span class="ann" title="Supported: City and County of Los Angeles portion was indeed $50 million, not Federal Reserve as stated." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$50 million</span>).

**Lawsuits and Settlements:**

In 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who were affected by the scandal. The settlement provided compensation to customers who were charged fees on unauthorized accounts.

In <span class="ann" title="Unknown: While some events occurred in 2017, Carrie Tolstedt retired in 2016, not 2017 as stated in the timeline." style="background:#eef2ff;border-color:#6366f1;color:#3730a3;">2017</span>, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $80 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that the bank had misled investors about its sales practices.

**Executive Departures:**

In 2016, Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf resigned after facing intense pressure from regulators and lawmakers. Stumpf was replaced by Timothy Sloan, who served as CEO until <span class="ann" title="Supported: Timothy Sloan did resign as CEO in March 2019." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2019</span>.
