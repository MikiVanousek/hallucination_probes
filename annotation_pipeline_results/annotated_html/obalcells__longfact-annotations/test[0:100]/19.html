  <div class="message">Louis Pasteur (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">December 27, 1822</span> – <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Pasteur died on September 28, 1895" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">September 28, 1895</span>) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his groundbreaking contributions to vaccination, germ theory, and disease prevention. He is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 19th century.

**Early Life and Education**

Pasteur was born in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he was born in Dole, France" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Dole, France</span>, to a tanner&#x27;s family. His father, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm his father&#x27;s name was Jean-Joseph Pasteur" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Jean-Joseph Pasteur</span>, was a <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources consistently describe Jean-Joseph as a tanner and sergeant major, but no sources mention him being a wine merchant" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">tanner and a wine merchant</span>. Louis was the <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Louis was the third child, not the eldest, and had siblings but not necessarily five total" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">eldest of five children</span>. He suffered from poor eyesight and was initially considered unsuitable for a career in science. However, his passion for science and his determination led him to pursue a career in chemistry.

Pasteur studied at the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he studied at École Normale Supérieure" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">École Normale Supérieure in Paris</span>, where he <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm he completed his doctorate in 1847" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">earned his degree in 1847</span>. He then became a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm he was appointed to Strasbourg in 1848 and moved to Lille in 1854" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, where he taught from 1849 to 1854</span>.

**Germ Theory and Vaccination**

Pasteur&#x27;s most significant contributions were in the fields of germ theory and vaccination. In <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Pasteur worked on disproving spontaneous generation starting in 1859, but germ theory developed gradually through his fermentation work, not proposed as a complete theory in 1859" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1859, he proposed the germ theory of disease</span>, which posits that microorganisms are the primary cause of many diseases. This theory revolutionized the understanding of disease and paved the way for the development of vaccines.

One of Pasteur&#x27;s most notable achievements was the development of the rabies vaccine. In <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the rabies vaccination occurred in 1885" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1885</span>, he successfully vaccinated a 9-year-old boy named <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Joseph Meister was the first person to receive Pasteur&#x27;s rabies vaccine" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Joseph Meister</span>, who had been bitten by a rabid dog. The boy survived, and Pasteur&#x27;s vaccine became a standard treatment for rabies.

**Other Contributions**

Pasteur&#x27;s contributions extended beyond vaccination and germ theory. He made significant contributions to the fields of:

1. **Silkworm disease**: Pasteur developed a method to prevent the spread of a disease that was killing silkworms, which led to a significant increase in silk production in France.
2. **Vinegar production**: Pasteur developed a method to produce vinegar that was free from contamination, which led to the development of a new industry.
3. **Beer and wine production**: Pasteur&#x27;s work on the spoilage of beer and wine led to the development of pasteurization, a process that involves heating liquids to a high temperature to kill bacteria and other microorganisms.

**Personal Life**

Pasteur married <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he married Marie Laurent in 1849" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Marie Laurent in 1849</span>, and they had five children together. He was a devout Catholic and believed that his work was a way to serve God.

**Legacy**

Pasteur&#x27;s legacy is immense. He is credited with saving countless lives through his work on vaccination and germ theory. He was awarded numerous honors, including the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he received the Copley Medal in 1874" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Copley Medal in 1874</span> and the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he received the Rumford Medal in 1856" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Rumford Medal in 1856</span>.
