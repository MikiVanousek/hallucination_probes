  <div class="message">Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that deals with the properties and behavior of integers and other whole numbers. It is a vast and intricate field that has been studied for thousands of years, with contributions from many mathematicians and scientists throughout history.

**Prime Numbers**

Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The study of prime numbers dates back to ancient Greece, where Euclid (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Euclid is consistently dated to around 300 BCE in multiple sources, with &#x27;fl.&#x27; (flourished) being the appropriate notation since exact birth/death dates are unknown." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">fl. 300 BCE</span>) proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers. The distribution of prime numbers is still not fully understood, and it remains one of the most important unsolved problems in number theory.

Some notable results in the study of prime numbers include:

* The Prime Number Theorem (PNT), which describes the distribution of prime numbers among the integers. The PNT was first conjectured by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Gauss was born April 30, 1777 and died February 23, 1855." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855)</span> and was finally proved by <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While sources confirm Hadamard proved the Prime Number Theorem in 1896, I could not find verification of his exact birth and death years in the search results." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963)</span> and <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm he was born August 14, 1866 and died March 2, 1962." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin (1866-1962)</span> in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm that both Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin independently proved the Prime Number Theorem in 1896." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1896</span>.
* The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), which is a conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers that was first proposed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm Riemann was born September 17, 1826 and died July 20, 1866." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866)</span> in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the Riemann Hypothesis was formulated in Riemann&#x27;s 1859 paper &#x27;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&#x27;." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1859</span>. The RH has important implications for many areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and analysis.

**Divisors**

Divisors are integers that divide another integer without leaving a remainder. The study of divisors is closely related to the study of prime numbers, as every integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.

Some notable results in the study of divisors include:

* The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in a unique way. This theorem was first proved by Euclid and has been a cornerstone of number theory ever since.
* The concept of greatest common divisors (GCDs), which is a fundamental concept in number theory. The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

**Congruences**

Congruences are equations in which the solutions are integers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by a certain integer. Congruences are a fundamental concept in number theory and have many applications in cryptography and coding theory.

Some notable results in the study of congruences include:

* The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which is a theorem that describes how to solve systems of congruences. The CRT was first proved by the Chinese mathematician <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate the Chinese mathematician Sun Zi (associated with the Chinese Remainder Theorem) lived around 3rd-5th century CE (around 400 AD), not 100 BCE. The completion confuses this with the earlier military strategist Sun Tzu." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Sun Tzu (fl. 100 BCE)</span> and has been a cornerstone of number theory ever since.
* The concept of modular arithmetic, which is a system of arithmetic in which the solutions are integers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by a certain integer.

**Quadratic Residues**

Quadratic residues are integers that can be expressed as the square of another integer. The study of quadratic residues is closely related to the study of congruences and has many applications in cryptography and coding theory.

Some notable results in the study of quadratic residues include:

* The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, which is a theorem that describes how to determine whether a quadratic residue is a square or not. The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity was first proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss and has been a cornerstone of number theory ever since.
* The concept of quadratic reciprocity, which is a fundamental concept in number theory. Quadratic reciprocity is a theorem that describes how to determine whether a quadratic residue is a square or not.

**Applications in Cryptography, Coding Theory, and Computer Science**

Number theory has many applications in cryptography, coding theory, and computer science. Some notable examples include:

* **Public-Key Cryptography**: Number theory is the foundation of public-key cryptography, which is a method of secure communication that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Public-key cryptography is widely used in secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS and PGP.
* **Error-Correcting Codes**: Number theory is used in the construction of error-correcting codes, which are used to detect and correct errors in digital communication. Error-correcting codes are widely used in digital communication systems such as CDMA and OFDM.
* **Computer Science**: Number theory is used in many areas of computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity theory. Some notable examples include the use of number theory in the construction of algorithms for solving systems of linear equations and the use of number theory in the analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms.

**Interplay with Other Mathematical Fields**

Number theory intersects and interplays with many other mathematical fields, including algebra, geometry, and analysis. Some notable examples include:

* **Algebra**: Number theory is closely related to algebra, as many of the concepts and techniques of number theory are also used in algebra. Some notable examples include the use of number theory in the study of groups and rings and the use of number theory in the study of Galois theory.
* **Geometry**: Number theory is also closely related to geometry, as many of the concepts and techniques of number theory are also used in geometry. Some notable examples include the use of number theory in the study of elliptic curves and the use of number theory in the study of modular forms.
* **Analysis**: Number theory is also closely related to analysis, as many of the concepts and techniques of number theory are also used in analysis. Some notable examples include the use of number theory in the study of Fourier analysis and the use of number theory in the study of harmonic analysis.

**Notable Mathematicians and Their Contributions**
