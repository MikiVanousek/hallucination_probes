  <div class="message">The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a prominent Catholic church located in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is located in Mexico City, Mexico, specifically in the Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo area." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Mexico City, Mexico</span>. It is one of the most visited and revered Catholic shrines in the world, dedicated to the veneration of the Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

**History and Significance**

The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built on the site where, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin, a Native American convert to Christianity, on <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm that the first apparition of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego occurred on December 9, 1531." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">December 9, 1531</span>. The apparition is said to have occurred on the hill of Tepeyac, which was a sacred site for the Aztecs.

During the apparition, the Virgin Mary asked Saint Juan Diego to build a church in her honor on the site. However, the bishop at the time, Juan de Zumárraga, was skeptical of the apparition and asked for a sign to prove its authenticity. The Virgin Mary then instructed Saint Juan Diego to gather roses from the top of the hill, which he did, despite the fact that it was not the season for roses to bloom. When he presented the roses to the bishop, they were found to be miraculously fragrant and had petals that were not yet open, which convinced the bishop of the authenticity of the apparition.

**Construction and Architecture**

The original church was built in 1531, but it was <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not find reliable sources confirming that the original church was destroyed by Aztecs in 1541." style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">destroyed by the Aztecs in 1541</span>.
