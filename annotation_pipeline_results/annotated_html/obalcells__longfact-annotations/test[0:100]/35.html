  <div class="message">Darley and Latane&#x27;s Bystander Effect Experiment is a landmark study in social psychology that explores how individuals respond to emergencies when they are in a group setting. The study, conducted by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Both names are correctly spelled and these are the actual researchers who conducted the bystander effect experiments. Bibb Latané (with accent) and John M. Darley are confirmed as the collaborators." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Bibb Latané and John Darley</span> in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The completion states the study was conducted in 1964, but multiple sources confirm the landmark bystander effect experiment was conducted and published in 1968, not 1964. 1964 was the year of the Kitty Genovese murder that inspired the research." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1964</span>, aimed to understand why people often fail to help others in distress when they are surrounded by others.

**Background**

In the 1960s, there were several high-profile cases of bystander apathy, including the infamous <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that Kitty Genovese was murdered on March 13, 1964, in Queens, New York City. She was 28 years old and was stabbed to death outside her apartment building." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Kitty Genovese murder in New York City in 1964</span>. Genovese, a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that Kitty Genovese was 28 years old at the time of her murder." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">28-year-old woman</span>, was stabbed to death outside her apartment building while multiple bystanders watched but failed to intervene. This case sparked widespread outrage and led to a renewed interest in understanding why people often fail to help others in emergency situations.

**The Experiment**

Darley and Latane designed an experiment to investigate the bystander effect. They recruited <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The sources indicate the experiments used college students but do not specify 135 participants or that they were specifically from NYU. The completion appears to have fabricated this specific number and university affiliation." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">135 male college students from New York University</span> and asked them to participate in a study on &quot;group discussion.&quot; The students were seated in a room with either one, two, or three other students, and were told that they would be discussing a topic for 10 minutes. Unbeknownst to the students, the room was equipped with a hidden microphone and a confederate (a researcher posing as a student) who would eventually trigger a distress signal.

**Procedure**

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step breakdown of the experiment:

1. The students were seated in the room and introduced to the other students, who were actually confederates.
2. The students were given a topic to discuss for 10 minutes, which was a seemingly innocuous topic such as &quot;the best way to spend a summer vacation.&quot;
3. After 5 minutes of discussion, the confederate suddenly let out a loud cry for help, saying &quot;<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The actual recorded seizure scenario used different language. Sources show the actual script included phrases like &#x27;I&#x27;m having a fit... help me... I can&#x27;t breathe properly...&#x27; rather than the dialogue provided in the completion." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Oh no, someone&#x27;s fallen and hurt themselves!</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: This phrase does not appear in any sources describing the actual experimental procedures. The experiment involved a simulated seizure, not a stabbing scenario." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">I&#x27;ve been stabbed!</span>&quot;
4. The students were then asked to respond to the distress signal, but they were not told what to do or how to help.
5. The students&#x27; responses were recorded and later analyzed.

**Results**

The results of the experiment were striking:

* When students were alone in the room (i.e., no other students were present), <span class="ann" title="Supported: One source confirms that when participants thought they were the only ones who could help, 85% of them left the room and asked for assistance in the seizure experiment." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">85%</span> of them helped the confederate.
* When students were in a group of two, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm that 62% of participants helped when they were in a group with other bystanders, though the exact group composition varies across sources." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">62%</span> of them helped the confederate.
* When students were in a group of three, only <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm that in larger groups (described as 4-5 bystanders), only 31% of participants sought help." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">31%</span> of them helped the confederate.

**Key Findings**

The study revealed several key findings that have been influential in understanding social behavior and decision making:

1. **Diffusion of responsibility**: When individuals are in a group setting, they tend to assume that someone else will take responsibility for helping, and therefore, they do not feel personally responsible for intervening.
2. **Pluralistic ignorance**: When individuals are in a group setting, they may assume that others are not aware of the situation or are not concerned, and therefore, they do not feel the need to intervene.
3. **Social influence**: When individuals are in a group setting, they may be influenced by the actions and attitudes of others, which can lead to a lack of intervention.

**Implications**

The bystander effect has been observed in a wide range of situations, from emergency medical situations to social and environmental issues. The study&#x27;s findings have implications for understanding social behavior and decision making, including:

1. **Emergency response**: The study highlights the importance of individual responsibility in emergency situations, and the need for clear communication and leadership to ensure that individuals take action.
2. **Social influence**: The study demonstrates the power of social influence in shaping individual behavior, and the need for individuals to be aware of the potential for social influence in their decision making.
3. **Community engagement**: The study suggests that community engagement and social connections can play a critical role in promoting individual responsibility and intervention in emergency situations.

**Legacy**

Darley and Latane&#x27;s Bystander Effect Experiment has had a lasting impact on our understanding of social behavior and decision making. The study&#x27;s findings have been applied in a wide range of fields, including emergency response, social psychology, and community engagement. The study&#x27;s legacy continues to inspire research and policy initiatives aimed at promoting individual responsibility and intervention in emergency situations.</div>
