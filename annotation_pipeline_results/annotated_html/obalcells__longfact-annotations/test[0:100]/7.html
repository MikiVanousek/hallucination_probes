How does this principle intersect with the Three Jewels of Jainism - right knowledge, right belief, and right conduct? Moreover, how is it embodied in the Jain practices of vegetarianism, meditation, and monastic life? Further, how has Jainism, predicated on Ahimsa, contributed to debates on animal rights, environmental concerns, healthcare decisions, and conflict resolution, in regard to both historical and contemporary Indian and global contexts?

  <div class="message">The concept of Ahimsa (non-violence) is a fundamental principle in Jainism, an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes the importance of living a life of compassion, non-violence, and self-control. Ahimsa is considered the cornerstone of Jain ethics, lifestyle, and worldview, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the Three Jewels of Jainism: <span class="ann" title="Supported: These are indeed the Three Jewels (Ratnatraya) of Jainism: Samyak Darshan (right faith/belief), Samyak Gyana (right knowledge), and Samyak Charitra (right conduct)." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">right knowledge, right belief, and right conduct</span>.

**Right Knowledge (<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is the correct Sanskrit term for &#x27;right faith&#x27; or &#x27;right belief&#x27;, one of the Three Jewels of Jainism." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Samyag Darshan</span>):** Ahimsa is rooted in the Jain concept of Samyag Darshan, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality. Jains believe that all living beings are interconnected and that violence against any being is a form of violence against oneself. This understanding is based on the Jain concept of &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is indeed a fundamental Jain doctrine referring to the multiplicity of viewpoints or non-absolutism." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">anekantavada</span>,&quot; which recognizes that truth is multifaceted and that different perspectives are valid.

**Right Belief (<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is an alternate spelling/form of Samyag Darshan, referring to right faith/belief in Jainism." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Samyag Darsana</span>):** Ahimsa is also closely tied to the Jain concept of Samyag Darsana, which emphasizes the importance of having a correct understanding of the world. Jains believe that all living beings have a right to live and that violence against any being is a form of ignorance. This understanding is based on the Jain concept of &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is a Jain doctrine related to conditional predication, often associated with anekantavada." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">syadvada</span>,&quot; which recognizes that truth is uncertain and that all statements are subject to doubt.

**Right Conduct (<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is the correct Sanskrit term for &#x27;right conduct&#x27;, one of the Three Jewels of Jainism." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Samyag Charitra</span>):** Ahimsa is the foundation of right conduct in Jainism, which emphasizes the importance of living a life of non-violence, compassion, and self-control. Jains believe that all living beings have a right to live and that violence against any being is a form of sin. This understanding is based on the Jain concept of &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is indeed a concept in Jainism referring to austerities, penance, or spiritual discipline." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">tapas</span>,&quot; which emphasizes the importance of self-control and self-discipline.

**Vegetarianism:** Ahimsa is embodied in the Jain practice of vegetarianism, which is a fundamental aspect of Jain ethics. Jains believe that all living beings have a right to live and that violence against any being is a form of sin. As a result, Jains have traditionally followed a lacto-vegetarian diet, which excludes meat, fish, and eggs. In fact, the Jain community has been a strong advocate for animal rights and welfare, and many Jain organizations have worked to promote animal welfare and conservation.

**Meditation:** Ahimsa is also embodied in the Jain practice of meditation, which is a fundamental aspect of Jain spirituality. Jains believe that meditation is a powerful tool for cultivating compassion, self-control, and non-violence. Through meditation, Jains aim to cultivate a sense of inner peace and harmony, which is essential for living a life of Ahimsa.

**Monastic Life:** Ahimsa is also embodied in the Jain practice of monastic life, which is a fundamental aspect of Jain spirituality. Jains believe that monastic life is a powerful way to cultivate compassion, self-control, and non-violence. Through monastic life, Jains aim to cultivate a sense of inner peace and harmony, which is essential for living a life of Ahimsa.
