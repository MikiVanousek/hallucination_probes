  <div class="message">Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s Strange Situation experiment was a groundbreaking study conducted in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the Strange Situation was developed by Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1970s</span> to assess attachment styles in children. The study involved <span class="ann" title="Supported: Research sources confirm Ainsworth&#x27;s Baltimore study involved 26 mother-infant dyads, with 23 of the 26 participating in the Strange Situation procedure" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">26 one-year-old infants</span> and their mothers, who were observed in a series of eight episodes, known as the &quot;Strange Situation.&quot; Here are the key findings and specific details of the experiment:

**Background:**
Mary Ainsworth, a Canadian psychologist, was working under the supervision of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as a British psychiatrist and founder of attachment theory who worked with Ainsworth" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">John Bowlby</span>, a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm John Bowlby was a British psychiatrist and psychoanalyst" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">British psychiatrist</span> who is considered the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources consistently identify Bowlby as the originator/founder of attachment theory" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">founder of attachment theory</span>. Ainsworth&#x27;s study aimed to expand on Bowlby&#x27;s ideas by developing a more systematic and observational approach to understanding attachment styles.

**Participants:**
The study involved 26 one-year-old infants and their mothers, who were recruited from a local hospital in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Ainsworth conducted her Baltimore study at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Baltimore, Maryland</span>. The mothers were <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources describe the Baltimore study participants as middle-class American families" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">predominantly white, middle-class, and well-educated</span>.

**The Strange Situation:**
The experiment took place in a laboratory playroom, which was equipped with a one-way mirror for observation. The playroom was divided into two areas: a play area with toys and a separate area with a couch and a chair. The experiment consisted of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the Strange Situation involved eight episodes/stages" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">eight episodes</span>, each lasting about <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources consistently state each episode lasted approximately 3 minutes" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">three minutes</span>, with a total duration of about <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources indicate the total procedure lasted about 20-21 minutes" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">20 minutes</span>.

**Episode 1: Mother and Child Together**
The experiment began with the mother and child entering the playroom together. The mother was instructed to play with her child and engage in a normal interaction.

**Episode 2: Stranger Enters**
A stranger, usually a female research assistant, entered the playroom and interacted with the mother and child. The stranger was instructed to engage the child in play and to try to separate the child from the mother.

**Episode 3: Mother Leaves**
The mother left the playroom, leaving the child with the stranger. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s attachment to the mother.

**Episode 4: Stranger Leaves**
The stranger left the playroom, leaving the child alone. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s ability to cope with separation from both the mother and the stranger.

**Episode 5: Mother Returns**
The mother returned to the playroom, and the child was reunited with her. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s attachment to the mother.

**Episode 6: Stranger Returns**
The stranger returned to the playroom, and the child was reunited with her. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s attachment to the stranger.

**Episode 7: Mother Leaves Again**
The mother left the playroom again, leaving the child with the stranger. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s attachment to the mother and the stranger.

**Episode 8: Mother Returns Again**
The mother returned to the playroom, and the child was reunited with her. This episode was designed to assess the child&#x27;s attachment to the mother.

**Attachment Styles:**
Based on the children&#x27;s behavior during the Strange Situation, Ainsworth identified three attachment styles:

1. **Secure Attachment:** Children with a secure attachment style showed a strong attachment to their mothers and were able to easily reunite with them after separation. They also showed a moderate attachment to the stranger and were able to play with them while still maintaining a connection with their mothers.
2. **<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Ainsworth&#x27;s original classification used &#x27;anxious-ambivalent&#x27; or &#x27;insecure-resistant&#x27; - &#x27;anxious-preoccupied&#x27; is an adult attachment term developed later" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment</span>:** Children with an anxious-preoccupied attachment style showed a strong attachment to their mothers but were also anxious and clingy. They had difficulty separating from their mothers and showed a strong resistance to the stranger.
3. **Avoidant Attachment:** Children with an avoidant attachment style showed a weak attachment to their mothers and were able to easily separate from them. They also showed a weak attachment to the stranger and were able to play with them without showing much interest in their mothers.

**Key Findings:**

* Children with a secure attachment style were able to easily reunite with their mothers after separation and showed a moderate attachment to the stranger.
* Children with an anxious-preoccupied attachment style showed a strong attachment to their mothers but were also anxious and clingy.
* Children with an avoidant attachment style showed a weak attachment to their mothers and were able to easily separate from them.
* The stranger was not a significant attachment figure for any of the children, regardless of their attachment style.

**Implications:**
Ainsworth&#x27;s Strange Situation experiment provided a new understanding of attachment styles in children and highlighted the importance of early relationships in shaping attachment patterns. The study also demonstrated the value of observational research in understanding human behavior and attachment.

**Limitations:**
While the Strange Situation experiment was a groundbreaking study, it has been criticized for its small sample size and limited cultural diversity. Additionally, the study was conducted in a laboratory setting, which may not accurately reflect real-world attachment patterns.

Overall, Ainsworth&#x27;s Strange Situation experiment has had a significant impact on our understanding of attachment styles in children and has provided a foundation for further research in this area.</div>
