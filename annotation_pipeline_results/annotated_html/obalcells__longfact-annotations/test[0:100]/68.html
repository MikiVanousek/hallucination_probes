  <div class="message">Blobitecture, also known as Blobism or Blob architecture, is a style of contemporary architecture characterized by fluid, shapeless, and irregular forms. This architectural movement emerged in the 1990s and has been gaining popularity since then. The term &quot;Blob&quot; was first used by architect <span class="ann" title="Supported: Peter Eisenman is a real architect, confirmed as an American architect born in 1932, known for deconstructive designs." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Peter Eisenman</span> in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The completion claims Peter Eisenman used the term &#x27;Blob&#x27; in 1995, but multiple sources confirm it was Greg Lynn who coined &#x27;blob architecture&#x27; in 1995, not Peter Eisenman." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1995</span> to describe a building that defied traditional notions of form and structure.

**Principle of Blobitecture**

Blobitecture is based on the idea of challenging traditional notions of architecture and creating buildings that are more expressive and emotive. The style is characterized by:

1. **Organic forms**: Blobitecture buildings often have irregular, curved, and amoeba-like shapes that defy traditional notions of form and structure.
2. **Non-rectilinear geometry**: Blobitecture buildings often use non-rectilinear geometry, such as curves, spirals, and irregular shapes.
3. **Expressive and emotive**: Blobitecture buildings are designed to evoke emotions and create a sense of wonder and curiosity.
4. **Integration with the environment**: Blobitecture buildings often incorporate natural elements, such as water, light, and vegetation, into their design.

**Technological Achievements**

The technological advancements in computer-aided design (CAD) software, building information modeling (BIM), and 3D printing have made it possible to create complex and irregular shapes that were previously impossible to achieve. Some of the key technological achievements that have enabled Blobitecture include:

1. **Parametric design**: Parametric design software, such as Grasshopper and Rhino, allows architects to create complex shapes and forms using algorithms and mathematical equations.
2. **3D printing**: 3D printing technology has enabled architects to create complex shapes and structures that were previously impossible to achieve.
3. **BIM**: Building information modeling (BIM) software has enabled architects to create detailed and accurate models of buildings, including complex shapes and forms.

**Examples of Blobitecture**

Some notable examples of Blobitecture include:

1. **The Walt Disney Concert Hall** (Los Angeles, California, USA): Designed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Frank Gehry is confirmed as the architect of the Walt Disney Concert Hall." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Frank Gehry</span>, this building is a classic example of Blobitecture, with its irregular, curved shape and expressive design.
2. **The <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a real building designed by Frank Gehry." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Guggenheim Museum</span>** (Bilbao, Spain): Designed by Frank Gehry, this building is another example of Blobitecture, with its flowing, curved shape and expressive design.
3. **The <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Lotus Temple in New Delhi is a real building, confirmed as the Bahá&#x27;í House of Worship." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Lotus Temple</span>** (New Delhi, India): Designed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Fariborz Sahba is confirmed as the Iranian architect who designed the Lotus Temple, completed in 1986." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Fariborz Sahba</span>, this building is a classic example of Blobitecture, with its irregular, curved shape and expressive design.
4. **The <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Sydney Opera House is a real building in Sydney, Australia." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Sydney Opera House</span>** (Sydney, Australia): Designed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Jørn Utzon is confirmed as the Danish architect who designed the Sydney Opera House." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Jørn Utzon</span>, this building is a classic example of Blobitecture, with its irregular, curved shape and expressive design.

**Changing the Aesthetic Boundaries**

Blobitecture is changing the aesthetic boundaries of the relationship between design, space, and end-users in modern architecture in several ways:

1. **Challenging traditional notions of form and structure**: Blobitecture is challenging traditional notions of form and structure, creating buildings that are more expressive and emotive.
2. **Creating a sense of wonder and curiosity**: Blobitecture buildings often evoke emotions and create a sense of wonder and curiosity.
3. **Integrating with the environment**: Blobitecture buildings often incorporate natural elements, such as water, light, and vegetation, into their design.
4. **Creating a sense of community**: Blobitecture buildings often create a sense of community and connection among users.

**Notable Architects**

Some notable architects who have contributed to the development of Blobitecture include:

1. **Frank Gehry**: Known for his expressive and emotive designs, Gehry is a pioneer of Blobitecture.
2. **Peter Eisenman**: Eisenman is a pioneer of Blobitecture, and his use of the term &quot;Blob&quot; in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm that Greg Lynn coined the term &#x27;blob architecture&#x27; in 1995." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1995</span> helped to define the style.
3. **Jørn Utzon**: Utzon is a pioneer of Blobitecture, and his design for the Sydney Opera House is a classic example of the style.
4. **Fariborz Sahba**: Sahba is a pioneer of Blobitecture, and his design for the Lotus Temple is a classic example of the style.

**Timeline**

* 1995: Peter Eisenman uses the term &quot;Blob&quot; to describe a building that defies traditional notions of form and structure.
* <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The completion states the Walt Disney Concert Hall was completed in 1997, but multiple sources confirm it opened on October 23, 2003." style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1997</span>: Frank Gehry&#x27;s <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a real building designed by Frank Gehry in Los Angeles." style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Walt Disney Concert Hall</span> is completed, becoming a classic example of Blobitecture.
* 2000s: Blobitecture becomes a popular architectural style, with many buildings being designed and completed around the world.
* 2010s: 3D printing technology becomes more widely available, enabling architects to create complex shapes and structures that were previously impossible to achieve.

**Conclusion**

Blobitecture is a style of contemporary architecture that challenges traditional notions of form and structure, creating buildings that are more expressive and emotive. The technological advancements in CAD software, BIM, and 3D printing have made it possible to create complex and irregular shapes that were previously impossible to achieve. Blobitecture is changing the aesthetic boundaries of the relationship between design, space, and end-users in modern architecture, creating a sense of wonder and curiosity, and integrating with the environment.</div>
