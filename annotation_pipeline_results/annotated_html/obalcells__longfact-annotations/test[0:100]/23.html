The film is based on the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Michael Punke&#x27;s novel was published in 2002" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">2002</span> novel &quot;The Revenant: A Novel of the American West&quot; by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as the author of the source novel" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Michael Punke</span>, which is inspired by the real-life experiences of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as the real historical figure the story is based on" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Hugh Glass</span>, a fur trapper and explorer.

**Plot**

The film is set in the early 19th century, specifically in <span class="ann" title="Supported: The historical events took place in 1823" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1823</span>, during the height of the fur trade in the American West. The story follows Hugh Glass (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as playing Hugh Glass" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Leonardo DiCaprio</span>), a seasoned fur trapper and explorer who works for the <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The Rocky Mountain Fur Company was not formed until 1830, seven years after the 1823 events. The actual company was the Henry &amp; Ashley Company" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Rocky Mountain Fur Company</span>. Glass is hired by John Fitzgerald (played by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as playing John Fitzgerald" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Tom Hardy</span>), a fellow trapper, to lead an expedition to find a valuable beaver hide.

During the expedition, Glass and his team, including Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter) and <span class="ann" title="Supported: John Fitzgerald was a real person who left Hugh Glass for dead" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">John Fitzgerald</span>, are ambushed by a group of Native American warriors. In the ensuing battle, Glass is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his companions, who believe he is mortally wounded.

However, Glass manages to survive and begins a perilous journey to seek revenge against those who left him for dead. Along the way, he faces numerous challenges, including treacherous terrain, harsh weather conditions, and encounters with hostile Native American tribes.
