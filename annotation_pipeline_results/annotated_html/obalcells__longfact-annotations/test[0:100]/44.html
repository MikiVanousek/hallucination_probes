    <div class="subtle"><strong>user_prompt:</strong> What is the significance of Moksha in Hindu philosophy and spirituality, and how do the paths of Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Raja Yoga guide an individual towards attaining this ultimate liberation, according to the various interpretations within Hindu scriptures? Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)
</div>

  <div class="message">Moksha, also known as liberation or self-realization, is the ultimate goal in Hindu philosophy and spirituality. It is the state of freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara), and the attainment of ultimate bliss and knowledge. The significance of Moksha is rooted in the concept of the Atman (the individual self) and the Paramatman (the ultimate reality or Brahman).

According to Hindu scriptures, there are four main paths or yogas that guide an individual towards attaining Moksha:

1. **Karma Yoga**: The path of selfless action, which involves performing one&#x27;s duties without attachment to the outcome. This path is associated with the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture attributed to the sage <span class="ann" title="Supported: Vyasa is confirmed as the traditional author of the Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata in multiple sources" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Vyasa</span>, who is said to have lived around <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The Bhagavad Gita is dated to 2nd-1st century BCE or later, not specifically 400 BCE. Most sources give ranges like 500 BCE-450 CE with later dates more commonly accepted" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">400 BCE</span> in the kingdom of <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Hastinapura is located about 37 km from Meerut, not in modern-day Meerut itself. It&#x27;s a separate town in Uttar Pradesh" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Hastinapura (modern-day Meerut, India)</span>. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches Prince Arjuna the importance of performing one&#x27;s duties without attachment to the outcome, and how this path leads to Moksha.

Example: In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, &quot;<span class="ann" title="Supported: This is confirmed as an accurate translation of Bhagavad Gita verse 2.47, found in multiple authoritative sources" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty</span>&quot; (2.47).

2. **Bhakti Yoga**: The path of devotion, which involves cultivating love and devotion for the ultimate reality or a personal deity. This path is associated with the Bhakti Sutras of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Narada is confirmed as the sage traditionally associated with the Narada Bhakti Sutras" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Narada</span>, a Hindu sage who is said to have lived around <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific dating of 200 BCE found for Narada or the Bhakti Sutras. The texts are generally considered much later compositions" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">200 BCE</span> in the kingdom of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No evidence found linking Narada specifically to the kingdom of Magadha or composing the Bhakti Sutras there" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Magadha (modern-day Bihar, India)</span>. In the Bhakti Sutras, Narada teaches the importance of cultivating love and devotion for the ultimate reality, and how this path leads to Moksha.

Example: In the Bhakti Sutras, Narada says, &quot;<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify this specific quote as being from Narada Bhakti Sutras verse 1.1 in available sources" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">The devotee who has a strong attachment to the ultimate reality and who has a strong desire to attain it, will certainly attain it</span>&quot; (1.1).

3. **Jnana Yoga**: The path of knowledge, which involves cultivating wisdom and understanding of the ultimate reality. This path is associated with the Upanishads, a collection of Hindu scriptures that are said to have been composed around <span class="ann" title="Supported: The early Upanishads are dated to around 800-300 BCE range, with some sources specifically mentioning 800 BCE as the early date" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">800 BCE</span> in the kingdom of <span class="ann" title="Supported: The Kuru kingdom is confirmed to have been located in modern-day Haryana, with their first capital at Assandh in Haryana" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Kuru (modern-day Haryana, India)</span>. In the Upanishads, the sage <span class="ann" title="Supported: Yajnavalkya is confirmed as a prominent sage in the Upanishads, particularly the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Yajnavalkya</span> teaches the importance of cultivating wisdom and understanding of the ultimate reality, and how this path leads to Moksha.

Example: In the Upanishads, Yajnavalkya says, &quot;<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify this specific quote as being from Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4.5.15 in available sources" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">The ultimate reality is beyond the reach of the senses, and it is beyond the reach of the mind. It is beyond the reach of the intellect, and it is beyond the reach of the ego</span>&quot; (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4.5.15).

4. **Raja Yoga**: The path of meditation and concentration, which involves cultivating a state of inner peace and awareness. This path is associated with the Yoga Sutras of <span class="ann" title="Supported: Patanjali is confirmed as the traditional author/compiler of the Yoga Sutras" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Patanjali</span>, a Hindu sage who is said to have lived around <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm that the Yoga Sutras are dated to around 400 CE, with one scholar specifically dating them to about 400 CE" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">400 CE</span> in the kingdom of <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No evidence found linking Patanjali to Pataliputra/Patna. The location where Patanjali composed the Yoga Sutras is not specified in sources" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Pataliputra (modern-day Patna, India)</span>. In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali teaches the importance of cultivating a state of inner peace and awareness, and how this path leads to Moksha.

Example: In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali says, &quot;<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify this specific quote as being from Yoga Sutras 1.2 in available sources" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">The state of inner peace and awareness is the ultimate goal of yoga, and it is the state of liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth</span>&quot; (Yoga Sutras 1.2).

In addition to these four paths, there are several other yogas and practices that are associated with Moksha, including:

* **Hatha Yoga**: A physical and spiritual practice that involves cultivating a state of inner balance and harmony.
* **Mantra Yoga**: A practice that involves using sound and vibration to cultivate a state of inner peace and awareness.
* **Tantra Yoga**: A practice that involves using the body and the senses to cultivate a state of inner awareness and union with the ultimate reality.

Overall, the paths of Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Raja Yoga provide a framework for individuals to cultivate a state of inner awareness and union with the ultimate reality, and to attain Moksha.
