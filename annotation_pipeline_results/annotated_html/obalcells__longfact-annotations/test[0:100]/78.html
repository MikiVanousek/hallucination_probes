The crashes were <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources including Wikipedia and news reports that Lion Air Flight 610 crashed on October 29, 2018" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018</span>, and <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources that Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on March 10, 2019" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019</span>.

**Lion Air Flight 610 (October 29, 2018)**

- Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 Max 8, took off from Jakarta, Indonesia, at <span class="ann" title="Supported: Wikipedia confirms Lion Air Flight 610 took off at 6:20 am local time on October 29, 2018" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">6:20 AM local time (UTC+7)</span> bound for Pangkal Pinang, Indonesia.
- The aircraft was a relatively new plane, having been delivered to Lion Air just four days prior to the crash.
- The pilots, <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: The roles are reversed - Bhavye Suneja was the Captain and Harvino was the First Officer, not the other way around" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Captain Harvino and First Officer Bhavye Suneja</span>, were experienced, but they had not received training on the 737 Max&#x27;s new MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) system.
- The MCAS system was designed to prevent the aircraft from stalling by automatically pushing the nose of the plane down if it sensed the aircraft was in a stall.
- However, the system relied on data from a single angle of attack (AOA) sensor, which was prone to malfunction.
- During the flight, the pilots encountered a series of issues, including a faulty AOA sensor, which caused the MCAS system to activate and push the nose of the plane down.
- The pilots attempted to correct the issue by manually adjusting the plane&#x27;s trim, but the MCAS system continued to activate, causing the plane to crash into the Java Sea just <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Lion Air Flight 610 crashed 13 minutes after takeoff" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">13 minutes after takeoff</span>.

**Investigation and Findings**

- The <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee led the investigation" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC)</span> led the investigation into the crash.
- The NTSC found that the probable cause of the crash was the MCAS system&#x27;s activation due to a faulty AOA sensor, which was not properly maintained or inspected by Lion Air.
- The investigation also revealed that Boeing had not provided adequate training to pilots on the MCAS system, and that the company had not disclosed the existence of the system to regulators.

**Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (March 10, 2019)**

- Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing 737 Max 8, took off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at <span class="ann" title="Supported: Wikipedia confirms Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 took off at 08:38:00 local time (05:38:00 UTC)" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">8:38 AM local time (UTC+3)</span> bound for Nairobi, Kenya.
- The aircraft was crewed by <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed by multiple sources including Wikipedia that Captain Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed (slight spelling variation) were the pilots" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Captain Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmed Nur Mohammod</span>.
- The pilots encountered a series of issues, including a faulty AOA sensor, which caused the MCAS system to activate and push the nose of the plane down.
- The pilots attempted to correct the issue by manually adjusting the plane&#x27;s trim, but the MCAS system continued to activate, causing the plane to crash into a field near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, just <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed six minutes after takeoff" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">six minutes after takeoff</span>.

**Investigation and Findings**

- The <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Sources refer to &#x27;Ethiopian authorities&#x27; and &#x27;Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau&#x27; but specific mention of ECAA as lead investigator not clearly confirmed" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA)</span> led the investigation into the crash.
- The ECAA found that the probable cause of the crash was the MCAS system&#x27;s activation due to a faulty AOA sensor, which was not properly maintained or inspected by Ethiopian Airlines.
- The investigation also revealed that Boeing had not provided adequate training to pilots on the MCAS system, and that the company had not disclosed the existence of the system to regulators.

**Controversy and Fallout**

- The crashes led to a global grounding of the 737 Max fleet, with over 400 aircraft affected.
- Boeing faced intense scrutiny and criticism for its handling of the MCAS system and its failure to disclose the system to regulators.
- The company&#x27;s CEO, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed as Boeing CEO during the 737 Max crisis" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Dennis Muilenburg</span>, was forced to resign in October 2019.
- The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faced criticism for its approval of the 737 Max, with some lawmakers calling for the resignation of the agency&#x27;s administrator, Stephen Dickson.
- The crashes also led to a series of lawsuits against Boeing, including a <span class="ann" title="Supported: Confirmed that Boeing agreed to pay over $2.5 billion in settlement with the Department of Justice" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">$2.5 billion settlement</span> with the US Department of Justice.
