  <div class="message">The Abrahamic covenant is a central concept in Jewish theology, law (Halakha), and communal life. It is a divine promise made by God to Abraham, the first patriarch of the Jewish people, in which God promises to make Abraham the father of a great nation, to give him and his descendants the land of Canaan, and to be their God.

**The Covenant in Jewish Theology**

The Abrahamic covenant is seen as a foundational event in Jewish theology, establishing the relationship between God and the Jewish people. It is based on the biblical account in <span class="ann" title="Supported: This is a correct biblical reference for the Abrahamic covenant" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Genesis 12:1-3</span>, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Genesis 15:1-21 is a correct biblical reference for covenant passages" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">15:1-21</span>, and <span class="ann" title="Supported: Genesis 17:1-27 is a correct biblical reference for covenant passages" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">17:1-27</span>. The covenant is seen as a unilateral promise by God, in which God commits to being the God of Abraham and his descendants, and to giving them the land of Canaan.

It is seen as the basis for the Jewish people&#x27;s right to the land of Israel, and for the commandments (mitzvot) that are given to the Jewish people. The covenant is also seen as the basis for the concept of chosen peoplehood, in which the Jewish people are seen as chosen by God to be a holy people.

The Abrahamic covenant has shaped Jewish communal life in many ways. It is seen as the basis for the Jewish people&#x27;s identity and sense of purpose.
