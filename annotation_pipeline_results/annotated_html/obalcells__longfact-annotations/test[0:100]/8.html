  <div class="message">Ambroise Paré (<span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Paré was born around 1510 and died on December 20, 1590" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">c. 1510 - December 20, 1590</span>) was a French barber-surgeon who played a significant role in the development of surgical techniques and medical practices during the Renaissance period. He is often referred to as the &quot;Father of Surgery&quot; in France.

**Early Life and Training**

Ambroise Paré was born in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources consistently state he was born in Bourg-Hersent (later incorporated into Laval), not Bourg-en-Bresse" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Bourg-en-Bresse</span>, a town in the region of <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: He was born in Bourg-Hersent in the province of Maine (northwestern France), not Bourgogne-Franche-Comté" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Bourgogne-Franche-Comté</span>, France. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 1510. Paré&#x27;s early life and education are not well-documented, but it is believed that he began his career as a barber-surgeon, a common occupation for those who combined barbering and surgery skills.

**Career**

Paré&#x27;s career spanned over four decades, during which he served as a surgeon to several French monarchs, including <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate he served as army surgeon under Francis I (1536-1538) but became royal surgeon to Henry II in 1552, not Francis I in 1536" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Francis I</span>, <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm he served as royal surgeon to Henry II" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Henry II</span>, and <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm he served Charles IX as royal surgeon" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Charles IX</span>. He was appointed as the royal surgeon to Francis I in <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: He joined the army in 1536 but became royal surgeon to Henry II in 1552, not Francis I in 1536" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">1536</span>, at the age of 26. Paré&#x27;s expertise and innovative techniques earned him a reputation as one of the most skilled surgeons of his time.

**Contributions to Surgery**

Paré made significant contributions to the field of surgery, including:

1. **Amputation techniques**: Paré developed a new method of amputation, which involved ligating the arteries and veins before cutting through the bone. This technique reduced the risk of bleeding and improved the chances of survival for patients undergoing amputation.
2. **Gunshot wounds**: Paré wrote extensively on the treatment of gunshot wounds, which were a common injury during the Renaissance period. He developed a technique for removing bullets from wounds, which involved using a pair of forceps to grasp the bullet and then extracting it from the wound.
3. **Surgical instruments**: Paré designed and developed new surgical instruments, including forceps, scalpels, and probes. His designs were more efficient and effective than those used by previous surgeons.
4. **Anatomical studies**: Paré conducted detailed anatomical studies, which helped to improve our understanding of the human body. He wrote several books on anatomy, including &quot;La méthode de préparer les corps humains&quot; (The Method of Preparing Human Bodies).

**Notable Cases**

Paré was involved in several notable cases, including:

1. **The treatment of King Henry II**: In <span class="ann" title="Supported: Henry II was indeed injured in a jousting tournament in 1559 and Paré treated him" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1559</span>, Paré was called to treat King Henry II, who had been injured in a jousting tournament. Paré performed a series of operations to repair the king&#x27;s wounds, but unfortunately, the king died several days later.
2. **The treatment of Charles IX**: In <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: No specific evidence found of Charles IX being injured in a fall from a horse in 1562 and treated by Paré" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">1562</span>, Paré treated Charles IX, who had been injured in a fall from a horse. Paré performed a series of operations to repair the king&#x27;s wounds, and the king made a full recovery.

**Legacy**

Ambroise Paré&#x27;s legacy is significant, and he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of surgery. He wrote several books on surgery and anatomy, including &quot;La méthode de préparer les corps humains&quot; (The Method of Preparing Human Bodies) and &quot;La chirurgie&quot; (The Surgery). Paré&#x27;s contributions to surgery have had a lasting impact on the field, and he is still studied and revered by surgeons and medical historians today.

**Personal Life**

Paré married a woman named <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Sources mention he was twice married but do not specifically name his wife as Marguerite" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Marguerite</span>, and they had several children together. He was a devout Catholic and was known for his piety and charitable works. Paré died on December 20, 1590, at the age of 80, and was buried in the church of <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate he was buried at the church of Saint-André-des-Arts, not Saint-Germain-des-Prés" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">Saint-Germain-des-Prés</span> in Paris.
