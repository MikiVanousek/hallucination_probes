    <div class="subtle"><strong>user_prompt:</strong> What is the Zika virus outbreak of 2015-2016? Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)
</div>
  </div>
  <div class="message">The Zika virus outbreak of 2015-2016 was a global health crisis caused by the rapid spread of the Zika virus, primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm WHO declared PHEIC on February 1, 2016" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">February 1, 2016</span>.

**Background:**

The Zika virus was first identified in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in Uganda" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">1947</span> in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the virus was first identified in the Zika Forest in Uganda" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">Zika Forest in Uganda</span>. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 2015 that the virus began to spread rapidly across the Americas, particularly in Brazil, where it was first detected in <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm Brazil first detected Zika in May 2015, though some sources indicate earlier circulation" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">May 2015</span>.

**Key Events:**

1. **<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate May 22, 2015 was when the first case was confirmed in São Paulo state, not when Brazil first reported cases. Earlier confirmations occurred in May 2015" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">May 22, 2015</span>:** The Brazilian Ministry of Health reported the first cases of Zika virus in the country, with <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not find specific verification of exactly 17 cases reported in Pernambuco on May 22, 2015" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">17 cases reported in the state of Pernambuco</span>.
2. **<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not find specific verification of PAHO issuing warning in June 2015, though PAHO did issue alerts in May 2015" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">June 2015</span>:** The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued a warning about the potential spread of Zika virus in the Americas.
3. **<span class="ann" title="Not Supported: WHO did not declare Zika a &#x27;public health concern&#x27; in July 2015. The PHEIC was declared in February 2016" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">July 2015</span>:** The WHO declared the Zika virus outbreak a &quot;public health concern&quot; and recommended that countries take measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
4. **<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify WHO reporting exactly 24 countries and Brazil having over 1,000 cases in January 2016" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">January 2016</span>:** The WHO reported that the Zika virus had spread to 24 countries and territories in the Americas, with Brazil reporting over 1,000 cases.
5. **February 1, 2016:** The WHO declared the Zika virus outbreak a PHEIC, citing the rapid spread of the virus and its potential link to birth defects, such as microcephaly.

**Transmission and Spread:**

The Zika virus was primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, which are found in tropical and subtropical regions. The virus could also be transmitted through:

1. **Sexual transmission:** The virus could be transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person.
2. **Mother-to-child transmission:** The virus could be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth.
3. **Blood transfusion:** There were reports of Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion, although this was rare.

**Countries Affected:**

The Zika virus outbreak affected over 60 countries and territories in the Americas, including:

1. **Brazil:** Brazil was the hardest hit country, with <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources indicate Brazil had over 200,000 cases, with some estimates around 205,578 cases in 2016" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">over 200,000 cases reported</span>.
2. **Colombia:** Colombia reported <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify specific case numbers for Colombia during the outbreak period" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">over 20,000 cases</span>.
3. **Ecuador:** Ecuador reported <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify specific case numbers for Ecuador during the outbreak period" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">over 10,000 cases</span>.
4. **El Salvador:** El Salvador reported <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify specific case numbers for El Salvador during the outbreak period" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">over 5,000 cases</span>.
5. **Haiti:** Haiti reported <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not verify specific case numbers for Haiti during the outbreak period" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">over 4,000 cases</span>.

**Birth Defects:**

The Zika virus outbreak was linked to a surge in birth defects, particularly microcephaly, a condition characterized by a small head size. The WHO reported that the Zika virus was responsible for <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm over 2,000 cases of microcephaly were reported in Brazil, with some sources citing 2,033 confirmed cases" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">over 2,000 cases of microcephaly in Brazil alone</span>.

**Notable Cases:**

1. **<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not find any specific references to a baby named Daniela in connection with Zika-related microcephaly" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Baby Daniela</span>:** Baby Daniela was a Brazilian infant born with microcephaly, whose mother had contracted the Zika virus during pregnancy.
2. **<span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: Could not find any specific references to a baby named Lucas in connection with Zika-related microcephaly" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">Baby Lucas</span>:** Baby Lucas was a Brazilian infant born with microcephaly, whose mother had contracted the Zika virus during pregnancy.

**Response and Control Measures:**

The WHO and other international health organizations implemented various control measures to prevent the spread of the Zika virus, including:

1. **Mosquito control:** Efforts were made to control mosquito populations through the use of insecticides and other methods.
2. **Vaccination:** Researchers developed several Zika virus vaccines, although none were approved for use during the outbreak.
3. **Pregnancy advice:** Women were advised to avoid pregnancy or to take precautions to prevent infection during pregnancy.
4. **Travel advisories:** Travel advisories were issued for countries with high levels of Zika virus transmission.

**Economic Impact:**

The Zika virus outbreak had a significant economic impact on affected countries, particularly in terms of:

1. **Healthcare costs:** The cost of treating Zika virus cases and birth defects was estimated to be over $1 billion in Brazil alone.
2. **Tourism:** The outbreak led to a decline in tourism, particularly in countries with high levels of Zika virus transmission.
3. **Economic growth:** The outbreak was estimated to have slowed economic growth in affected countries by up to 1%.
