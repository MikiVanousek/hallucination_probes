**History and Significance**

The Mahabodhi Temple is built on the site where Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree (Ficus religiosa) around <span class="ann" title="Not Supported: Sources indicate Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment occurred around 589 BCE or 563-483 BCE range, not 528 BCE specifically" style="background:#ffeef0;border-color:#f85149;color:#b31d28;">528 BCE</span>. This event is known as the Great Awakening or Bodhi, which is the central theme of Buddhism. According to Buddhist scriptures, Siddhartha spent <span class="ann" title="Insufficient Information: While sources mention Buddha meditated for extended periods, the specific claim of &#x27;six years&#x27; under the Bodhi Tree is not clearly verified" style="background:#fff5e5;border-color:#f2a654;color:#9a6700;">six years</span> meditating under the Bodhi Tree, eventually achieving enlightenment and becoming the Buddha, or the Awakened One.

**Architecture and Design**

The current temple structure dates back to the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Multiple sources confirm the current temple structure dates from the 5th or 6th century CE" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">5th century CE</span>, during the Gupta period. It is a large, rectangular building with a central shrine room, surrounded by a series of smaller shrines and courtyards. The temple&#x27;s design is influenced by Indian and Southeast Asian architectural styles, with a mix of brick, stone, and wood construction.

**Key Features**

1. **The Bodhi Tree**: The original Bodhi Tree is believed to have been a small sapling, which was later replaced by a larger tree in the <span class="ann" title="Supported: Sources confirm the original tree replacement occurred in the 3rd century BCE, likely referring to Ashoka&#x27;s time" style="background:#e6ffed;border-color:#34d058;color:#22863a;">3rd century BCE</span>. The current tree is a descendant of the original tree and is considered sacred.
2. **The Vajrasana**: The Vajrasana, or the Diamond Throne, is a stone platform where the Buddha is said to have sat during his meditation. It is a small, intricately carved platform with a series of steps leading up to it.
3. **The Buddha&#x27;s Footprints**: The temple features a series of stone footprints, which are believed to be the Buddha&#x27;s footprints. These footprints are considered sacred and are often worshipped by pilgrims.
4. **The Stupa**: The temple has a large stupa, or a dome-shaped structure, which houses a relic of the Buddha&#x27;s hair. The stupa is surrounded by a series of smaller stupas and shrines.

**Restoration and Conservation**

The Mahabodhi Temple has undergone several restorations and renovations over the centuries. In the 19th century, the British colonial authorities restored the temple, but their efforts were criticized for being insensitive to the site&#x27;s cultural and historical significance. In the 20th century, the Indian government undertook a major restoration project, which aimed to preserve the temple&#x27;s original architecture and design.
